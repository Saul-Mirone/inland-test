## Creating Your First Editor

Milkdown provides two distinct approaches to create an editor, each suited for different needs:

### 1. üçº Using `@milkdown/kit` (Build from Scratch)

This approach gives you complete control over your editor. Use this if you want to:

* Build a custom editor from the ground up

* Have full control over which features to include

* Create a highly customized editing experience

* Integrate with specific frameworks or requirements
